  <h2> Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong> The Rice:</strong> Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak it in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
       <li><strong>The Oil:</strong>  In a large pot or pan, heat the oil or ghee over medium heat.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Aromatics:</strong> Add cumin seeds, cloves, cardamom pods, and bay leaf. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant. Then add chopped onions and cook until golden brown.
    </li>
<li><strong>Add Garlic and Ginger:</strong> Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute.
</li>  
<li><strong>Tomatoes and Spices: </strong>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft. Mix in the coriander powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for a few more minutes until everything is well combined.
</li>
<li><strong>Add Rice:</strong> Stir in the drained rice, ensuring it's well coated with the spices. Cook for a couple of minutes, allowing it to toast slightly.
</li>
<li><strong>Add Liquid: </strong>Pour in the water or broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.
</li>
<li><strong>Fluff and Serve:</strong> Once done, turn off the heat and let it sit covered for another 5-10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork and serve hot, garnished with fresh cilantro if desired.
