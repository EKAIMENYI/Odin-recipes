    <h2> Ingridients</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>1 cup rice (white or brown)</li> 
<li>2 cups water (for white rice) or 2.5 cups water (for brown rice)</li>
<li>Salt (optional)</li>
<li>Butter or oil (optional)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Rinse the Rice:

        Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve or bowl. Rinse it under cold running water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming gummy.
    </li> 
    <li>Soak (Optional):
    
        Soaking the rice for 30 minutes can help improve the texture, especially for long-grain varieties.
    </li>
    <li>Measure Water:
    
        For white rice, use a 2:1 ratio (2 cups of water for every 1 cup of rice). For brown rice, use a 2.5:1 ratio.
    </li>
    <li>Boil Water:
    
        In a pot, bring the measured water to a boil. If desired, add salt and a tablespoon of butter or oil for flavor.
    </li>
   <li>Add Rice:
    
    Once the water is boiling, add the rinsed rice. Stir briefly to prevent sticking.
</li> 
   <li>Cover and Simmer:
    
    Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and let it simmer. For white rice, cook for about 15-20 minutes; for brown rice, about 40-45 minutes.
</li> 
  <li>Check for Doneness:
    
    After the cooking time, check if all the water has been absorbed. If the rice is tender, it’s done. If there’s still water, cover and cook for a few more minutes.
</li>  
   <li> Fluff the Rice:
    
    Once cooked, remove the pot from heat. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then fluff the rice gently with a fork.
</li> 
   
   <li>Serve:
    
    Serve the rice as a side dish or base for your favorite main course.
</li> 
    </ul>
